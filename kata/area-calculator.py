# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. 
# Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

# Write your code below this line

  area = height * width
  num_of_cans = math.ceil(area / cover)
  print(f"You'll need {num_of_cans} of paint.")
  

# Write your code above this line
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# Don't change the code below
